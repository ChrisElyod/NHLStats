This project intends to use the (generally) undocumented NHL Statistics API to create a more well rounded, all in one Application for viewing NHL Stats.

## Statistics to Display

For Teams\Players it should display

### Teams

The teams past 10 seasons with all relevant statistics. Clicking on the year itself will display more information about that year as well as pace information for the year (Actual pace vs. pace to make the playoffs).
Comparing two years will display the prior mentioned more information comparing the two years to one another.

**Note: pace information is based on the rule of thumb that a team requires roughly 6 point every 5 games in order to reach the playoffs**

### Players

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
